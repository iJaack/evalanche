# Evalanche

Avalanche-first agent wallet and execution SDK for AI agents, with multi-EVM support for holdings, payments, DeFi, bridge flows, prediction markets, and perpetuals.

<!-- GENERATED:release-summary:start -->
## Current Release

- Latest release: [v1.12.0](docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_1.12.0.md)
- Published package: `evalanche@1.12.0`
- Current package surface:
  - Adds first-class Robinhood Chain mainnet support through the named `robinhood` network alias and chain ID `4663`, with official ETH, RPC, explorer, and LI.FI metadata.
  - Extends wallet boot, network switching, MCP chain discovery and switching, and native holdings scans to Robinhood Chain through Evalanche's central EVM registry.
  - Adds production RPC overrides through `ROBINHOOD_RPC_URLS`, `EVALANCHE_ROBINHOOD_RPC_URLS`, and MCP `AVALANCHE_RPC_URL` while keeping the selected network alias authoritative.
  - Certifies LI.FI native ETH quote construction for Robinhood Chain and prevents non-Gas.zip routes from being mislabeled as Gas.zip.

## Install

```bash
npm install evalanche
```

Polymarket authenticated actions use the official `polymarket` CLI. Install it on production agents and keep it on a pinned path, or set `EVALANCHE_POLYMARKET_CLI_BIN=/absolute/path/to/polymarket`. Evalanche passes signer material through `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` in the child process environment and never through CLI argv.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Evalanche } from 'evalanche';

const { agent } = await Evalanche.boot({ network: 'avalanche' });

console.log(agent.address);

const holdings = await agent.holdings().scan();
console.log(holdings.summary);
```

```ts
const { agent: robinhoodAgent } = await Evalanche.boot({ network: 'robinhood' });
console.log(robinhoodAgent.getChainInfo()); // Robinhood Chain, chain ID 4663
```

Robinhood's public RPC is rate-limited. For production, set `ROBINHOOD_RPC_URLS` or `EVALANCHE_ROBINHOOD_RPC_URLS` to a comma-separated list of provider endpoints. LI.FI bridging is supported when a live route is available; Gas.zip does not currently advertise Robinhood Chain support.

## MCP

```bash
npx evalanche-mcp
```

Evalanche ships an MCP server for wallet actions, holdings discovery, DeFi, bridge and swap flows, Polymarket, and perpetual venues.
The default MCP transport is stdio. HTTP mode is available for local automation, but requires an explicit bearer token:

```bash
EVALANCHE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" npx evalanche-mcp --http --port 3402
```

## What It Does

- Avalanche-first wallet boot, identity, and agent execution flows
- Unified holdings discovery across wallet balances, DeFi positions, prediction positions, and perp venues
- Cross-chain bridge, swap, and gas-funding flows
- Avalanche and multi-EVM DeFi actions
- Polymarket market reads plus official-CLI-backed execution
- Perpetual trading support for Hyperliquid and dYdX

## Also Works Across EVM

Avalanche is the primary path, but Evalanche also supports Robinhood Chain, Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BSC, and other EVM networks for execution and holdings discovery.
